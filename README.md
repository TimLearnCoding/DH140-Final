# DH140-Final

## Topic:
This is my DH140 Final Project--a NLP analysis on English writer Lewis Carroll and his book *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* by techniques like sentiment analysis, network analysis and statistic analysis. The goal is to explore both the writer and his work through a computational-humanistic approach.

## Research Questions:

## I.Introduction
### Motivation
Lewis Carroll,the author of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and its sequel Through the Looking-Glass, is one of the most well-known children's fantasy writers from the 19th century. He’s also known by his real name Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, a brilliant mathematician and logician that invented the famous word ladder puzzle and had many significant contributions to the development of Mathematical Logic and Linear Algebra. While we’re astonished by Lewis’ outstanding achievements in both mathematics and literature, we may also want to explore the secret behind his talents–what he thinks about, how he reasons and the way he expresses. Apparently, the most direct key to access such secrets is his books.
By reading his book, we’re able to explore the inner world of this great mind and absorb intellectual nutrition from his creations. However, such endeavors could be fairly time-consuming and almost an unbearable burden for nowadays busy people. We then wonder: rather than dig deeply into the depth of Lewis’ writings, is there a more direct way to extract insights of his works or writing style through some analytic efforts? Fortunately, today we have many advanced techniques allowing us to perform such tasks and Natural Language Processing(NLP) is one of the most well-known methods in this field.In this project, I will perform various data analysis techniques, including NLP, on Lewis Carroll’s available works on Gutenberg.org and extract some insights from the analyses attemptedly, through which we can hopefully understand Lewis Carroll’s writing style better.
