# DH140-Final

## Topic:
This is my DH140 Final Project--a NLP analysis on English writer Lewis Carroll and his book *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* by techniques like sentiment analysis, network analysis and statistic analysis. The goal is to explore both the writer and his work through a computational-humanistic approach.


## Research Questions:
1. Compare Lewis Carroll to the other popular authors and discover insights about his writing style.
2. What the mood change in *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* along with its storyline?
3. Who are the main characters in *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* and which characters are relevant to them?
