# Project Introduction

## Data Description
Classics CSV is a dataset that collects the top 1000 most popular books on Project Gutenberg, as determined by downloads. In this dataset, each row represents a book, and the columns represent the book's corresponding authorship, publication date, congressional classication, and some other information. It also includes simple statistics computed by common metrics like sentiment analysis, average sentence length and etc.

## Motivation 
My main motivation for selecting this dataset is to apply the techniques I learnt in previous lectures into analyze my favorite classical literatures and their authors' writing style. Given the limit in time and scope, I decided to focus on the author Lewis Carroll and his best seller book *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* in this reserach project. I'll attempt to use techniques like sentiment analysis, network analysis and statistic analysis to discover Lewis Carroll's writing style and extract insights about *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* through those computational-humanistic analyses.

## Research Question(s)

1. Compare Lewis Carroll to the other popular authors and discover insights about his writing style.
2. What the mood change in *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* along with its storyline?
3. Who are the main characters in *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* and which characters are relevant to them?
